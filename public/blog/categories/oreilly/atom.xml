    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a marathon of hackery starting in April, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/5370">Jeff Burtoft</a> and I pushed out 90 hacks and 435 pages of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do">HTML5 Hacks</a> this week. We also had a few guest hackers that created some really great content as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Raymond Camden of Adobe</li>
<li>Phil Legetter of Pusher.com</li>
<li>Alexander Schulze of jWebsocket</li>
<li><a href="http://j.hn/">John Dyer</a> of Dallas Theological Seminary</li>
<li>Alex Sirota of FoxyTunes</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it was a great experience. What I enjoyed the most was getting into a workflow groove, much like when you are building an API or contributing to a project. With each hack, it was necessary to ideate, plan, create the code, test it, and then put it into a understandable format. By the end, I was feeling pretty efficient at kicking out interesting hacks pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I felt as though I improved over time, looking back is always interesting. I like to keep fine tuning and revising, but at some point you have to ship the product. I&rsquo;m really proud of the work, it has been hard, but I learned a ton in the process.</p>

<p>Most of my hacks I tried to make relevant to real world software development challenges, and mix in a number of HTML5 specifications. Hopefully, that turns out to benefit the reader &hellip; I&rsquo;m all ears on the feedback. So don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop us a line.</p>
