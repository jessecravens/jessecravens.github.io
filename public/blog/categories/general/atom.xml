    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2006/05/09/stopping-to-smell-the-synthetic-roses-exploring-the-virtual-world-marketplace</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I mentioned writing this post, and then I got sidetracked, yet I have been ponderig the virtual world marketplace for sometime. Today, I came across Max Kiesler&rsquo;s post <a href="http://www.maxkiesler.com/index.php/designdemo/fullview/506/">Stylehive&rsquo;s Virtual Showroom in Second Life</a>, and I was reinspired to further continue this thought pattern.</p>

<p>To put it simply, there appears to be something brewing in virtual reality. I am envisioning a fusion of all the &lsquo;Web 2.0&rsquo; technologies we have all become so sick of hearing about. As the web becomes saturated with social bookmarking, digital file sharing communities, virtual worlds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second Life are becoming more and more interesting</a>. Why? Complete immersion into the world, complete cusomization/personalization of oneself, and a natural extension of the real world marketpalce.  <img src="http://jessecravens.com/images/2006/02/350px_Appearance_modify.jpg" alt="350px_Appearance_modify.jpg" align="baseline" width="350" height="212" style="float:left; margin:10px" /></p>

<p><strong>Who has time for a Second Life? </strong>
I know I can barely keep up with my first one.</p>

<p>It is my guess that if more people had time to try a world like Second Life, or There.com, they would get hooked, or at least see some value in it. I personally don&rsquo;t spend much time inside Second Life. I did try it for a month or two, but it began to take too much time away from my First Life.</p>

<p><strong>So why am I so interested in a technology that I rarely use myself? </strong>
Currently, the Second Life client is heavy, and one needs a decent graphics card. Not all users have these cards and the world gets a little choppy. In other words, it takes too long to fire the thing up, and then when I am there it takes too long to get anything done. Interestingly enough, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/hive7-the-virtual-world-ajax-built">an ajax world, Hive7</a> has been built. Obviously Hive7 is in no way comparable to the complexities of an evolved offering such as Second Life, but it may not be that far off until it is.
<strong>
So what is it that I find so interesting?</strong></p>

<p>Stopping to Smell the Synthetic Roses: Why not take some time and explore these virtual worlds and see for yourself; There is something brewing in virtual worlds, and there has been for sometime. I know some of you are quite aware of the concept. Some of you may even make a common folkâ€™s living selling Elvisâ€“style lamb chops to synthetic representations of your cyber neighbors in the ocean side cantinas of your favorite virtual fantasy land, but others may have a difficult time understanding or even accepting this as a viable entrepreneurial pursuit. Here are a few more interesting links:</p>

<p>&ndash;<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982010.htm">A recent Business Week interview with economist Edward Castronova</a></p>

<p>&ndash;<a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/11/16/PM200511168.html">A radio show about Virtual Debt</a></p>

<p><strong>
Naysayers, Pessimists, and Neo-Luddites</strong>
Bah! It is hard not to imagine armies of mole-like humanoids momentarily emerging from their one room studio apartments to walk to the nearest Starbucks equipped with mobile technologies enabling them to keep up with the latest trends in multiple virtual real estate markets.</p>

<p>I sayâ€¦way cool, well except for the mole-like part. But think mobile. Think exist in there (there.com) and exist here at the same time. Think new and exciting markets. And even coolerâ€¦think virtual dollars that can be traded for authentic currency like the American dollar. After all currency is currency, and income is income.</p>

<p>So, I suggest extending the virtual presence. I suggest joining in on the development of the virtual browsers â€“ you know the browser that exists on the virtual notebook â€“ the avatar handheld.  I suggest billboard space in high traffic areas within the virtual world, and sponsored events like contests, and parties. To some, this is old hat, and they have probably already moved on to the next blog, but to the othersâ€¦have you considered the possibilities?</p>

<p><strong>Complete Cusomization/Personalization of Oneself</strong>
Once inside Second Life, you are given the controls to customize your appearance. This is closely related to the concept of personalizationâ€¦again, nothing new. Many large businesses have understood the power of this for sometime. For expample,the recent Nike Bodi Miller site, Toyota, Dell, Wendyâ€™s, the list goes onâ€¦what these companies have done is provide their customers with the opportunity to personalize their productsâ€“ what they have yet to achieve is the opportunity for customers to personalize themselves.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the psychological attraction to the virtual worlds is the personalization of the avatar and the avatars experience. We are talking about the personalization of oneself, or in other words, the reinventing of oneself. An idea that may  not be all together healthy if taken to the level of what some are calling &lsquo;Toxic Immersion.&rsquo;  Yet, in moderation our lives can be greatly enhanced by a healthy, escape from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>What about the artist, the small business, the entrepreneur? Can value be created or enhanced for your customer by extending your online presence into virtual worlds? </strong></p>

<p>Second Life is not your typical &lsquo;one-man shooter&rsquo; online game. Second life is a virtual world for a more sophisticated virtual citizenry.</p>

<p>-An <a href="http://news.com.com/Larry+Lessig+visits+Second+Life/2100-1043_3-6028916.html">article related to this topic</a>; High-Profile Authors visiting Second Life.</p>

<p>Some might argue that this is exactly what my database-driven online community already provides: a graphic interface that allows customers to experience my business and interact with the interface, and other customers. Well, this is different. I am describing a separate, yet connected reality.</p>

<p>I eventually have to ask myself â€“ â€œwhere am I going with this?â€ It is cluetranian philosophy â€“ so in virtual worlds like Second Life that I have no ultimate goal of conquering the 78th level Bossâ€¦what is there to do? Talk, Express, Vocalize, Chat, Gossip, Just hangout and build and buy cool stuff.</p>

<p>If a business can leverage their products and services by providing an online demo of the product, or tap into an additional network by meeting new people in an alternate reality, there may be some value in spending part of your 24 hours in a differnet world. Nevertheless, stop and smell the synthetic roses. If you don&rsquo;t you won&rsquo;t know what you are missing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I see this mistake often, and I often have to think about the difference between the two. So I thought I&rsquo;d share.</p>

<p><strong>Than versus Then.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Than</strong> is a conjunction or preposition used in unequal comparisons:
(The taco was tastier than the burrito.)</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong> is (usually) an adverb indicating time or consequence:
(I bit into the taco. It was then I realized, the taco was tastier than the burrito.)</p>

    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2006/04/25/siddhartha-reflection-blogging-and-thinking-before-we-speak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>He reflected deeply, until this feeling completely overwhelmed him and he reached a point where he recognized causes; for to recognize causes, it seemed to him, is to think, and through thought alone feelings become knowledge and are not lost, but become real and begin to mature. 

- Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha
</blockquote>


<p>One thing my mother always told me was, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a whole lot to say, but you sure have a lot to write about.&rdquo; These days, I communicate through talk much more effectively than I did when I was younger. Although, I still would prefer to have the time to think about what I say through a process like writing before I speak and stand the chance of being misunderstood.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone. Effective communication is numero uno in importance for the success of any relationship, we all know this, yet it is so difficult to find the time to do it well. I watch people struggle with this in everything I do and have done in the past. Communication is a multi-faceted interchange of ideas, feelings, beliefs. Energies are being exchanged, insecurities are covering thoughts, changing thoughts, and half truths are even spoken in the name of self-interest. It takes a very analytical individual to decipher individual intentions, yet we all have to be real. Stop and take a look around at what we have become:
<strong>
Marriages</strong>: Even the most sacred of words, the wedding vow, has become insincere hogwash in 50% of cases.
<strong>
The Death of the Salesman and All Marketers are Liars</strong>: Consumer purchasing decisions are becoming more and more based on the buying experiences of close friends and family.
<strong>
Politics</strong>: well&hellip;exactly my point.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it&hellip;insincerity has become a 21st Century American cultural norm, and surely all this insincerity has taken its toll on effective communication. Personally, I&rsquo;m weary of it.</p>

<p>Take the whole job interview process for example. As of lately, I have been acknowledging the whole idea of insincerity during the onset of the interview. In part, to evaluate the interviewer. If the interviewer acts as though they have no understanding of what I am referring to, I know from the beginning an unhealthy relationship may be in the making.</p>

<p>Maybe these dynamic, short-termed mindscapes are a reflection of environmental adaptations. In today&rsquo;s world, everything changes so fast&hellip;and we as individuals need to change to keep up. So maybe rampid insincerity is a reflection of this larger trend.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I feel it is important to reflect deeply, to check oneself, and evaluate one&rsquo;s own intentions.  As Hesse stated, we need to &lsquo;recognize the causes&rsquo; of our thoughts and actions. We need to think deeper about the ramifications of our words. Words are very powerful, and in today&rsquo;s world one simple statement can have a long lasting effect on another&rsquo;s impression of your integrity, honesty, etc. This is especially important in the workplace.</p>

<p>In conclusion&hellip;Writing, or a public style of writing such as blogging, helps us stay accountable for our thoughts. If we are brave enough to put these thoughts in writing for everyone to read, perhaps we are making a commitment to be more accountable to the ideas we are expressing. Maybe not. Either way, at least we are making a public commitment to think before we speak.</p>
