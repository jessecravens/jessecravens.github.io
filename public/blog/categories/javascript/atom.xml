    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Early Adoption of Ember</h2>

<p>Outside of architecting and developing complex web apps during my day job at <a href="http://frogdesign.com">frog design</a>, I spent a good part of 2014 finishing up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370926/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449370926&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjessecrave-20&linkId=6CCXPQ2HHNLSTI5N">Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwjessecrave-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449370926" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, teaching <a href="http://www.jessecravens.com/blog/2014/08/06/ember-dot-js-workshops/">Ember.js workshops</a>, and giving <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-art-and-science-of-shipping-single-page-apps-with-emberjs">a talk entitled: “The Art and Science of Shipping of SPAs with Ember.js.”</a></p>

<p>Each of these focus areas were obviously complimentary: the workshops serving as deep dives, the talks as the high level summaries, and the book and companion source code serving as a reference application and detailed documentation.</p>

<p><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-art-and-science-of-shipping-single-page-apps-with-emberjs"><img class="imgL400" alt="The Art and Science of Shipping Single Page Apps with Ember.js" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/blogposts/artandscience4.png"></a></p>

<p>At work, throughout 2013, 2014, and now into 2015, I have leveraged this momentum to educate cross-discipline teams of developers and designers and execute some very ambitious JavaScript applications for numerous clients. In a rapidly changing environment, it has been a pleasure to grow a team that now possesses framework-level expertise, allowing us to rapidly iterate on application feature sets without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>For me, all of this has been a culmination of experiences that started in the mid 2000s with PHP and Flash work while doing small business web design and CMS development, to large scale production of JavaScript and mobile hybrid apps in the late 2000s, and to now UI/UX focused, enterprise, rapid application development.</p>

<p>Perhaps, this excerpt from the prelude of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370926/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449370926&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjessecrave-20&linkId=6CCXPQ2HHNLSTI5N">Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a> explains my stance for the last couple of years:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since 2009, I have worked on numerous applications using Backbone, Angular, and
Ember. But today, I often recommend Ember.js to the clients I work with. This is primarily
due to the fact that the conventions support well-known web application development
patterns that I have custom written or pieced together from multiple open
source libraries. Here, are the high level concepts that, in my opinion, make Ember so
valuable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ember’s object model supports a classic and well understood, object-oriented
pattern of class inheritance through extend, object initialization, getters and setters,
and class monkey patching.</li>
<li>Ember models, controllers, and components extend the Object class, which ensures
that these objects inherit Ember’s powerful default data binding.</li>
<li>The router supports complex nesting for URL-driven applications that manage
application state in a conventional way that can be understood by those with
web-server-routing backgrounds.</li>
<li>Recently, build, workflow, and testing tools in Ember have matured and become
intuitive.</li>
<li>Ember’s only dependencies are on jQuery and Handlebars.js, two very wellknown
and documented libraries.</li>
<li>Finally, the community is vibrant, passionate, and extremely active.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>

<p>Most recently, I find myself moving into a new phase that mirrors the needs and concerns of the clients I interact with on a daily basis: navigating the SPA landscape and making future friendly decisions based on the complex solutions matrix that is now Ember 2.0, Angular 2.0, and current React/Flux.</p>

<p>My latest talk:  SPA 2.0: The latest in JavaScript frameworks will address these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What does the future hold for the building of complex applications on the Web Platform in 2015?
How do we manage the complex SPA landscape, and help our clients make future friendly architectural decisions?</p></li>
<li><p>Will an Angular 2.0 breaking rewrite send devs running for something better? Can React/Flux community offer a complete application framework solution for complex applications? Will Ember continue to evolve into a lighter framework that can shed it&rsquo;s &lsquo;monolithic framework&rsquo; reputation?</p></li>
<li><p>As the Angular and React communities adopt the Ember Router and the Ember community is inspired by React’s Virtual Dom to take advantage of it’s existing under utilized view graph, the communities are adopting the best of each other. In what other ways are the individual framework communities learning from each other?</p></li>
<li><p>Will native, cross browser web components become a reality? What is the IE roadmap in regards to custom elements, HTML templates, HTML imports, and shadow DOM? Will we begin writing web components in Ember without the use of handlebars syntax?</p></li>
<li><p>Will functional reactive ‘stream’ patterns become common place with better integration into frameworks, as promises did in 2014?</p></li>
<li><p>With ES6 modules ( and transpiler build steps ), as practitioners can we finally lay the JS module debacle to rest? Do Isomorphic JS architectures still make this a challenge?</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>SPA 2.0 Topic Areas</h2>

<p>Here, are the areas my talks will focus on in 2015:</p>

<ul>
<li>Framework Maturity and Stability</li>
<li>Developer Ergonomics, Tooling, and Front End Ops</li>
<li>View Performance and Mobile</li>
<li>Async Router</li>
<li>Data Binding (1-way , 2-way use cases)</li>
<li>ES6 modules</li>
<li>Web Components</li>
<li>Community and Documentation</li>
<li>Release Cycle</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late April, I took my Ember.js talk to Louisville, Kentucky for the <a href="http://http://www.codepalousa.com/">CodePaLOUsa</a> conference.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/demo-emberjs"><img class="imgR400" alt="O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/codepalousa14.png"></a></p>

<p>In the process I discovered <a href="http://doccrows.com/">Doc Crow&rsquo;s Southern Smokehouse and Raw Bar&rsquo;s</a> BBQ and Bourbon menu. I highly recommend it for anyone in the area trying to find authentic, local fare.</p>

<p>During the day, I also listened to some great talks from <a href="https://twitter.com/sireb">@sireb</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/robtarr">@robtarr</a>.</p>

<p>My presentation focused on demoing the latest versions of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">RockNRollCall demo application</a>, the source code for my upcoming book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030782.do">OReilly&rsquo;s Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of November, I was given an opportunity to give two talks in Malmö, Sweden at the Øredev conference. First of all, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the conference. Although the theme was the Arts, I found it to be a developer&rsquo;s conference with an artsy edge. The speakers I had a chance to see were developer&rsquo;s developers, one of my favorites being a talk on Meteor by Chris Mather (@eventedmind) of <a href="http://eventedmind.com">eventedmind.com</a>. I&rsquo;ve maintained a peripheral view of Meteor, so it was good to get a beginner to intermediate overview of its capabilities. Given that I have been doing <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> client work as of lately, I am particularly interested in exploring <a href="https://github.com/slacy/minimongo">minimongo</a>.</p>

<p><img class="imgR400" alt="Jesse Cravens at Øredev 2013 HTML5 Hacks" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/oredev/html5hacks-oredev.jpg"></p>

<p>The city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a> was also a pleasure to experience, and as you might imagine, the people of Sweden were very welcoming. One of the highlights for me was the speaker dinner at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jorchr-Malm%C3%B6_r%C3%A5dhus.jpg">Malmö City Hall</a>, originally constructed in the Middle Ages. On a side note, I finally had a chance to meet and have dinner with <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglass Crockford</a>, a long time inspiration and virtual mentor, who was in town to give the keynote on <a href="http://oredev.org/2013/wed-fri-conference/managing-asynchronicity-with-rq">Managing Async with RQ</a>.</p>

<p>My first talk was a preview of my new book <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">O'Reilly&rsquo;s Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a>. I shared the stage with co-author and fellow frog, <a href="http://bashmodernquantity.com/about/">Thomas Q. Brady</a>. We took the audience through the creation of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook/rocknrollcall">RocknRollCall</a>, an intermediate level <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> application that fills in many of the blanks that most of the &lsquo;Getting Started&rsquo; applications don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><img class="imgL400" alt="O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js by Jesse Cravens" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/oredev/ember_cover_600.png"></p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the book, and the talk, cover topics such as: a survey of Ember tooling, debugging with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en">Ember Inspector</a>, Ember boilerplates, app initializers, promises in Ember, the needs API, Ember components, 3rd Party JavaScript Integration (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>), Ember testing, SPA authentication, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> and other client-side persistence solutions, and remote data persistence with Ruby On Rails and Node.js.</p>

<p>My second talk was <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">HTML5 Hacks</a> Evolved, where I continue to share more hacks from by first book <a href="http://html5hacks.com">HTML5 Hacks</a>, and <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">html5hacks.com</a>. This talk is culmination of HTML5 specifications that will have you rethinking browser-based applications. Some of the highlights of this talk included: Web Workers, WebSocket w/ GeoLocation, Device Orientation, and LeapJS, Web Components / Polymer / Ember Components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Model Driven Views, and Local Storage.</p>

<p>In 2014, I&rsquo;m retiring the HTML5 Hacks talks, to begin focusing solely on Single Page Application development in 2014.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is mirrored from: <a href="http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/10/04/javascript-makers-how-js-is-helping-drive-the-maker-movement/">html5hacks.com</a></p>

<p><img class="imgR300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok1.jpg"></p>

<p>I spend my days writing a lot of JavaScript, and helping companies deliver ambitious UX focused applications to the web. I <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do?cmp=af-code-book-product_cj_9781449334994_7080585">author books</a> on the subject, blog, and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/jdcravens/">speak at conferences</a> as often as I can.</p>

<p>I work for <a href="http://frogdesign.com">frog</a>, a product design firm, that for the last forty years has been helping increase the profiles of brands like Sony and Apple through iconic design.</p>

<p>I work within a culture that has deep roots into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">the Maker Movement</a>; A culture that was making before the Maker Movement was cool, the &ldquo;original makers&rdquo; if you will. Written upon our walls and slide decks is the tag, <a href="https://vimeo.com/24940735">&lsquo;Love What You Make&rsquo;</a>, and as you might expect many of the frogs that sit around me are craftsfolk, DIYourselfers, and tinkerers. It is not uncommon to see a flying quadcopter, a mesh sensor network of Arduinos, 3D printed prototypes, explorations in next generation gesture with the Leap Motion and Kinect, video production, motion studies, 3D modeling, along with the standard artistic mood boards and web and native mobile application wireframes. Let&rsquo;s just say there is no shortage of creativity across every medium imaginable.</p>

<h2>Sharing My Craft with my Children</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference - setting up" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok2.jpg"></p>

<p>All of that being said, I&rsquo;m a parent of two young children. My little ones constantly challenge me to find ways to share quality time with them. The parents reading this know the juggling act.</p>

<p>What I try to do is architect bridges between my children&rsquo;s curiosity and the passions of others that have explored their crafts in a deep way. Myself, and my wife, being the most important of those craftsfolk.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m doing it right, when I spend time with my children, they should share in my excitement and passion. If I&rsquo;m doing it wrong, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed and exhausted from work. In my vision, my children should be witnessing a model of how to wake up everyday with the goal of embracing opportunity to create a combination of function and beauty within the world around them.</p>

<p><img class="imgR200" alt="Maker Faire" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/200ok/Maker_Faire.gif"></p>

<p>So it is in this context, that I met up with Mozilla&rsquo;s Luke Crouch, and <a href="http://makerfairetulsa.com/">Tulsa Mini Maker Faire</a>&rsquo;s Scott Phillips to put together <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">the closing keynote at the 200ok conference</a> .</p>

<h2>JavaScript Makers: How JS is Helping Drive the Maker Movement</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">200ok conference</a> is on track to become Oklaoma&rsquo;s premier web conference attracting a sold out crowd of web professionals from all over Oklahoma and the neighboring states. Going in, I felt as though I knew my audience well. In other words, if I spoke to them about languages they would understand, JavaScript and HTML5, my message would easily resonate. I also knew that given their location, Tulsa, OK, a presentation that touched upon work life balance and family values would immediate strike a chord as well.</p>

<p>So in the spirit of authenticity, I pretended as if getting prepared for a closing keynote dependent on hacked together hardware and software demos wasn&rsquo;t challenging enough; I made the decision to include my 6 year old son, Carter with a flying drone and a custom configured Minecraft server accessible over conference wifi. I knew this would ensure that the presentation dangled on the brink of disaster, mirroring the chaotic reality of both open hacking and parenting.</p>

<p>My thinking was that a presentation on this topic should be authentic, and reflect the reality of my proposition, not be an ivory tower, academic/authoritative talk about how to share your craft with your children. I also made sure to not prep Carter. With a loose structure in place, we took the stage and worked our way through a story that consisted of 12 open software and hardware demos that showcased JavaScript as a primary scripting language, and a table full of hardware that ranged from a drone, a dissected wifli helicopter and erector set, a leap motion, and numerous prototyping boards.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="10" data-id="78b4c9300a8801313e8202078d31cabc" data-ratio="1.2994923857868" src="http://www.jessecravens.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<h2>JavaScript and Prototyping Boards</h2>

<p>Earlier this year I did a presentation at HTML5.tx that focused on building an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00_BGRkBRM">Internet of Things with JavaScript</a> and various open hardware prototyping boards such as Arduino, BeagleBone, and the Raspberry Pi. It was in that talk that I made a connection that eventually led to an introduction to Luke. So, given that the HTML5.tx content was of interest I started the presentation with a demo of the Arduino, <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny Five</a>, the original Beaglebone and <a href="https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript">BoneScript</a>.</p>

<p>{% codeblock bonescript.js %}</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  require(&lsquo;bonescript&rsquo;);</p>

<p>  ledPin = bone.P8_3;
  ledPin2 = bone.P8_4;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  app.post(&lsquo;/motion&rsquo;, function(req, res, next) {</p>

<pre><code>console.log(req.body['eventType']);

res.send('Motion data collected for '  + req.body['eventType'] + ' event');

if (req.body['eventType'] == "motionstart"){
  digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
}
else if (req.body['eventType'] == "motionend") {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
}
</code></pre>

<p>  });</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h2>Nodecopter and the Leap Motion</h2>

<p>I started with the basics of the <a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone">node-ar-drone module</a>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock ar-drone.js %}</p>

<p>  var arDrone = require(&lsquo;ar-drone&rsquo;);
  var client  = arDrone.createClient();</p>

<p>  client.takeoff();</p>

<p>  client</p>

<p>Later, a crowd favorite was mapping the gestures from the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> to the <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR drone</a>, so that a one finger clockwise gesture triggered a nodecopter takeoff. A counter clockwise gesture then landed it. I was able to put this together using the leapJS and node-ardrone node modules, based on some initial hacking by <a href="https://twitter.com/markuskobler">Markus Kobler</a>, where he pulled this off at a <a href="https://github.com/markuskobler/nodecopter-london">Nodecopter London event</a>.</p>

<h2>ScriptCraft: Running JavaScript from within Minecraft</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok3.jpg"></p>

<p>Later, I showed how to script inside of the Minecraft virtual world, using <a href="https://twitter.com/walter">Walter Higgins'</a> great <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft">ScriptCraft library</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the conference wifi, and single access point, to suffice in allowing Carter and I to interact within virtual world. I was also concerned about the dynamic IP, and having to change it on the fly, start/restart the server, etc. So I made the decision 10 minutes before to not have Carter log in, and I would just speak to the possibility instead. In true 6 year old fashion, he rebelled and logged onto my server, popping up in front of me wearing a Creeper mask, as I was mid stream explaining how to script wooden signs with his 1st grade sight words as a homework exercise.</p>

<p>{% codeblock sightwords.js %}</p>

<p>Drone.extend(&lsquo;sightwords&rsquo;,function (){</p>

<pre><code>var wordsArr = ["have", "black", "three", "want", "get", "how", "two", "ten", "come", "went", "into", "know", "my", "do", "down", "who", "must", "let", "with", "red", "find", "will", "new", "live", "five", "you", "funny", "yes", "no", "may"]; 

for (i = 0;i &lt; wordsArr.length; i++){
    this.right(0+i).sign(wordsArr[i],68);
}

return this.move('sightwords');
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Needless to say, his innapropriate behavior was a crowd favorite. I have to admit, it was mine as well.</p>

<p>Going into the talk, I knew I&rsquo;d either be trying this again in the future or abandoning it as &lsquo;one of those ideas&rsquo; that sounded good in theory, but was just not going to work. Where did I land? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that Carter and I are looking for our next opportunity to share our experiences with other parents/web professionals.</p>
