    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another new design for <a href="http://sessionswest.com">SessionsWest.com</a>. I was digging for inspiration for this site, when Jeff called me from San Deigo last week right before he was about to go surfing. </a>The color scheme is known as &lsquo;Morning surf,&rsquo; and I built a custom flash player inspired by the album cover from the Fever Sessions. This new buildout has been my most complex drupal site to date. I embedded a photo gallery, and the mp3 player I mentioned earlier. I used drupal&rsquo;s front page module to give the home page a real clean, simple entry to the site. All in all it doesn&rsquo;t get much more simple, but I think thats what I like about it , and it reflects Jeff&rsquo;s style to the tee.</p>

Boy, Rodney can sing and play. It was a real pleasure.</p>

<p>I also had a pleasure to meet Lynn Myers: Guitar, Fiddle, Vocalist &amp; Band Director of the <a href="http://www.1000hillscc.com/band.html">Thousand Hills Cowboy Church Band</a>.
I love that ol' Country Gospel music and I am looking forward to checking him and the band out soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.1000hillscc.com/band.html"><img src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/2006/02/2_bandb.jpg" alt="2_bandb.jpg" align="baseline" width="200" height="298" style="margin: 10px; float: left; border: 0px"/></a>This evening, I had a chance to sit down with <a href="http://harleydean.com/index.php">Harley Dean</a> and play some country bass lines from his album, There and Back Again. I like Harley&rsquo;s songwriting and he has a great singing voice.<a href="http://harleydean.com"><img src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/2006/02/home_image.jpg" alt="home_image.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; border: 0px" align="baseline" width="220" height="120" /></a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the Digett team will be enjoying the tunes of client, Joel Rafeal (<a href="http://www.joelrafael.com/"><a href="http://www.joelrafael.com/">http://www.joelrafael.com/</a></a>) this Friday at the <a href="http://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.com/">Kerrville Folk Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll be at the <a href="http://www.kerrville-music.com/rootsbluesclinic.htm">Roots/Blues Workshop</a> in Kerrville Tues &ndash; Thur. I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting <a href="http://www.suefoley.com/">Sue Foley,</a> <a href="http://www.thadbeckman.com/">Thad Beckman</a>, <a href="http://www.stevejames.com/">Steve James</a> and the other instructors, and learning some new licks and techniques.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.northernlightsband.com/">The Northern Lights</a> will also be down from New England for the festival. <a href="http://www.northernlightsband.com/"><img src="http://www.jessecravens.com/images/2006/02/NLband.jpg" alt="NLband.jpg" align="baseline" style="margin: 10px; float: right; border: 0px" width="200" height="143" /></a>I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting up with them. In 2003, I had a chance to share the stage with these great bluegrass players and the late <a href="http://www.vassarclements.com/">Vassar Clements</a> at the <a href="http://elkhenge.com/">Elkhenge Music Festival</a> in WV. If you are into authentic bluegrass, don&rsquo;t miss their show.</p>

<p>Support Texas Music this summer &ndash; Its going to be a good one!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So digg and reddit have both posted on the work of Stu Nichols and his pure CSS photo gallery. Check it out: <a href="http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/lightbox.html#Trees">here</a>. I&rsquo;m anxious to try it out. I&rsquo;d like to find a way to blend this image gallery with a liquid three column layout, but the gallery is fixed &ndash; so it may have to be implemented on an internal page. Although, it would be interesting to have this image gallery present on a home page &ndash; since before the hover it only takes up the room of a horizontal menu. I&rsquo;ll be exploring this idea further &ndash; stay tuned.</p>

    <id>http://www.jessecravens.com/blog/2006/03/08/minishowcase-ajax-photogallery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Check out this ajax photogallery: <a href="http://minishowcase.backpackit.com/pub/367875">minishowcase</a>. It&rsquo;s lightweight, easy to customize, and a piece of cake to get up an running in no time. I removed the enormous Gallery2 from my server and replaced it with minishowcase. I lost the theming of Gallery 2, but minishowcase theming is on the way, and it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to create your own from scratch. Download also included easy to customize .css file.</p>

<p>For now it is fully functional in its own page <a href="http://jessecravens.com/gallery/">here</a>, but I will intgrate it as time permits.</p>

    <id>http://www.jessecravens.com/blog/2006/01/31/gallery2-plug-in-for-wordpress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://gallery.menalto.com/themes/gmc/logo.png" alt="Gallery2" /></p>

<p>I installed and configured the <a href="http://wpg2.ozgreg.com/index.php/Main_Page">gallery2 plug-in</a> today for Wordpress 2.0. I used the classic gallery 2 theme with the zen minimalist wordpress theme. There were a few tricks to get things working.</p>

<p>First of all, you need to have url paths turned off in order for gallery to show images inside the wordpress theme.
Also it may be necessary to set a minimum size for pictures to prevent a larger picture from breaking your page&hellip;.obviously depending on the template that you use. Feel free to <a href="mailto:jesse.cravens@gmail.com">email me</a> for help.</p>
