<p>For SXSWi and FluentConf this year, <a href="http://twitter.com/boyofgreen">@boyofgreen</a> and I created a demo application to showcase some of the hacks that we included in our book OReilly&rsquo;s HTML5 Hacks.</p>

<p>The demo application, Nerdclustr, is an HTML5 mobile application that brings &lsquo;nerds&rsquo; of all types together conferences and provides a visual map that updates in real time. The application was written with Node.js and the Express web framework. It demonstrates the following specifications: HTML5 Web Forms, Geo Location API, WebSocket, Canvas, CSS3 transforms.</p>

<p>Given, the attention that Web Components and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/polymer.html">Polymer.js</a> have been getting lately, I felt this was a good opportunity to demonstrate some of the exciting new specifications that are making their way to modern browsers. For the sake of this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll be using and providing screenshots of Google Chrome, but it should be worth your time to explore the status of each of the specifications in other modern browsers as well.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will take a look at the HTML5 specs mentioned above in detail. Then, we will explore Polymer.js and build out an example application.</p>

<p><img class="imgL200" alt="Jesse Cravens - Fluent Conf 2013" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/jesse_fluent.png"></p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to share the stage with Brendan Eich (Mozilla), Paul Irish (Google), Lea Verou (W3C), Bill Scott (PayPal), Jesse Freeman (Microsoft), Dion Almaer (Walmart.com), and dozens more in the field.</p>

<p>We also had a great turn out for the book signing, thanks for all the support. And congrats to Doug Hall for winning a free ebook copy of our book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do">HTML5 Hacks</a></p>

<p><img class="imgR300" alt="Jesse Cravens - Fluent Conf 2013" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/fluent_books.jpg"></p>

<p>As always we&rsquo;ve made all the code available and more at <a href="http://html5hacks.com">html5hacks.com</a>, and on github: <a href="http://github.com/html5hacks">github.com/html5hacks</a>.</p>

<p>I also added a few more new hacks, involoving Web Components (Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Custom Elements) and Polymer.js. You can find that source code available here: <a href="https://github.com/html5hacks/fluent2013-html5hacks">github.com/html5hacks/fluent2013-html5hacks</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been alot of fun co-presenting with Jeff, but my next two sessions, I will be going at HTML5 Hacking solo. You can catch my next presentations in NYC on July 24th–25th at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/devcon5/">Devcon5 2013 NYC</a> or November 4th–8th at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/redev/">Øredev 2013</a>.</p>
