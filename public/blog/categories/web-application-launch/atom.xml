    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Awhile back, I built a websocket powered interactive presentation framework called <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/robodeck">Robodeck</a>.</p>

<p>So I am calling it Generic American with a splash of Modern Vintage...I guess. I'm having one of those moments as a designer when the 'correct' images are present in my mind's eye, but for various reasons they haven't formulated on the canvas. Yet...but what the heck - I'm in no real hurry. I want to savor the taste of this one.</p>


<p>I absolutely love working on <a href="http://peacefield.info">peacefield.info</a>. It is a designer's dream, absolute creative freedom. An opportunity to shine, explore, create and innovate.</p>


<p>So what do I have to work with? Not much yet, and that is ok in some respects, because I don't want to ever steer away from my built in 'open source' aesthetic: championing the best of free fonts and hacked, and neo-Dadaist imagery. This new concoction hopes to blend cinematic urban cityscapes, with an adaptation of the ever trendy rustic earth tone color palette.(see my post on the the <a href="http://jessecravens.com/05122006/design/neo-green-aesthetic-tipping-point">Neo-Green Aesthetic</a>)</p>




<p>Actually, keyboardist R. Bruce Phillips says it best:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Peacefield isn't so "Pleasantville."  It's grittier, even darker maybe -- or at least it has that side.  Kind of like in the face of the ubiquitous B&W photo of the old man who lives on the street.  He is generic, he is vintage.  His face tells who knows what variety of stories?  Some lovely, and some horrific, to be sure.</p>

<p>But there is peace still.  His old weather face still attracts us.</p>

<p>Some may not see readily the quality of peace about this town.  They might think it a contradiction, or irony, that the gritty, mysterious town has such a "nice" name as "Peacefield."  Of course, America is full of contradiction and ironies, and people who don't get it when others do. </p>
</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am beginning to make educators aware of my launch of <a href="http://Campustechnology.org" target="_blank" title="Campustechnology.org">campustechnology.org</a> . </p>


<p><strong>What is the goal of campustechnology.org?</strong></p>


<p><a href="http://Campustechnology.org" target="_blank" title="Campustechnology.org">Campustechnology.org</a>  focuses on everything related to &#39;open education, open content, open systems thinking, open virtual learning environments, and open source instructional tools, and the hardware that promotes an &#39;open schools&#39; philosophy.   </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another new design for <a href="http://sessionswest.com">SessionsWest.com</a>. I was digging for inspiration for this site, when Jeff called me from San Deigo last week right before he was about to go surfing. </a>The color scheme is known as &lsquo;Morning surf,&rsquo; and I built a custom flash player inspired by the album cover from the Fever Sessions. This new buildout has been my most complex drupal site to date. I embedded a photo gallery, and the mp3 player I mentioned earlier. I used drupal&rsquo;s front page module to give the home page a real clean, simple entry to the site. All in all it doesn&rsquo;t get much more simple, but I think thats what I like about it , and it reflects Jeff&rsquo;s style to the tee.</p>

<p>I officially launched the rebuild of <a href="http://sessionswest.com/2.0/">sessionswest.com</a> today. The official website of a great local guitarist/singer-songwriter Jeff Anderson, a.k.a. el Jefe, and his recording studio in Boerne, TX.  El Jefe&rsquo;s music is an eclectic fusion of southern blues, country, and gospel. Some refer to Jeff&rsquo;s tunes as simply &lsquo;good ol&rsquo; down home feel good music.'</p>

<p>His latest release, Shine, is an inspirational collection of tunes that will brighten even the gloomiest of days. Shine is featured in the audio player @ sessionswest.com. Head on over and give er' a listen.</p>

<p>Features of the site include an audio player, custom video from Jeff&rsquo;s studio, and a photo gallery. Stay tuned for updates and add-ons.</p>
