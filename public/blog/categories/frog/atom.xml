    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Im giving a talk at Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco this afternoon: Client/Server 3.0: 6 Ways JavaScript is Revolutionizing the Client/Server Relationship. Here is the other talks on the agenda: <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/california/agenda.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<h3>1 Device Access Within the Browser</h3>

<p>The client gets smarter.</p>

<p>JavaScript Device APIs continue to evolve, allowing more access to device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications.
We will explore examples utilizing GeoLocation API, and Device Orientation.</p>

<h3>2 Client Side Processing w/ Background Threads</h3>

<p>The modern web browser&rsquo;s runtime is a single threaded, event loop. Asynchronous programming models, reactionary systems design actually benefit from this architecture. Maturing interpreters improve performance. Web Workers API enables background threads in the browser, making heavy computations realistic.</p>

<p>So, the client gets more powerful, and becomes an application development evnvironment.
We will explore Web Workers processing heavy computations without blocking the UI for further user interaction.</p>

<h3>3 Device Detection and Descriptors / Adaptive Frameworks</h3>

<p>Responsive Web Design is great, but it often isn&rsquo;t enough for larger applications, and applications that need to reach a highly fragmented device market. Adaptive frameworks use DDRs (Device Description Repositories)</p>

<p>We will explore a framework that mixes the best of Responsive with the best of Adaptive: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/responderjs">responderJS</a>.</p>

<h3>4 HTML5 Connectivity Revolution and HTTP 2.0</h3>

<p>Peter Lubbers coined the term, HTML5 Connectivity Revolution, to describe the next level, web network technologies such as: Web Sockets API, XHR2, Event Source and Server Sent Events, SPDY, CORS.</p>

<p>Engage in a demo of <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/robodeck">robodeck</a>, a Web Socket driven Collaborative presenations framework.</p>

<h3>5 Single Runtime, Shared Syntax &hellip; the right way</h3>

<p>Node.js has enabled the same language, single runtime. But, the paradigms are still quite different. Node streams, inspired by Linux pipes, make IO easy and intuitive. Explore pipe(), pump(), and events in Node streams.</p>

<p>Solutions like Browserify, help bring Node.js libraries and NPM dependency management to the browser. Next up, Domnode, wrapping common, client-side, I/O bound APIs (XHR, SSE, WebRTC, etc.) in Node streams syntax.</p>

<h3>6 Embedded JavaScript</h3>

<p>With Node.js, Angstrom Linux, and cloud document stores like MongoDB, the server is now embedded in the microcontroller client.</p>

<p>We will explore Arduino wrappers, and Node.js running on the Beaglebone from Texas Instruments.</p>

<p>The combination of Linux and JavaScript open worlds of opportunity.</p>

<p>Here is the node.js server used on the Beaglebone in the demo: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/beagleserver">beagleserver</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready for an upcoming talk titled: Rapid Prototyping HTML5 Applications with NodeJS, which I will presenting at <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/austin2012/Agenda/Agenda-at-a-glance.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; Austin</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<p>With HTML5, the modern web browser continues to mature as a capable application platform.
The new specifications are broad, impacting nearly every technology associated with modern web development including graphics, connectivity, client-side storage, offline access, graphics, multimedia, and performance.
JavaScript continues to be front and center as the core language. NodeJS extends JavaScript&rsquo;s event loop paradigm to the server, and provides JavaScript engineers with the ability to produce functionality deeper in the software stack. This phenomenon has had an impact on types of software development ranging from full-scale, enterprise, mobile applications to robot hobbyists platforms.
See innovative example solutions and learn why NodeJS is an ideal development platform for the production acceleration of next-generation HTML5 applications.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of a transition for me. With the release of HTML5 Hacks, I&rsquo;m beginning to focus more on my ubiquitous JavaScript content. I&rsquo;m excited, I have a lot to share.</p>

<p>Look for an update with a web based version of the slides.</p>
