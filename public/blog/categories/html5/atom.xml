    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late April, I took my Ember.js talk to Louisville, Kentucky for the <a href="http://http://www.codepalousa.com/">CodePaLOUsa</a> conference.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/demo-emberjs"><img class="imgR400" alt="O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js" src="http://jessecravens.github.io/images/codepalousa14.png"></a></p>

<p>In the process I discovered <a href="http://doccrows.com/">Doc Crow&rsquo;s Southern Smokehouse and Raw Bar&rsquo;s</a> BBQ and Bourbon menu. I highly recommend it for anyone in the area trying to find authentic, local fare.</p>

<p>During the day, I also listened to some great talks from <a href="https://twitter.com/sireb">@sireb</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/robtarr">@robtarr</a>.</p>

<p>My presentation focused on demoing the latest versions of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">RockNRollCall demo application</a>, the source code for my upcoming book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030782.do">OReilly&rsquo;s Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of November, I was given an opportunity to give two talks in Malmö, Sweden at the Øredev conference. First of all, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the conference. Although the theme was the Arts, I found it to be a developer&rsquo;s conference with an artsy edge. The speakers I had a chance to see were developer&rsquo;s developers, one of my favorites being a talk on Meteor by Chris Mather (@eventedmind) of <a href="http://eventedmind.com">eventedmind.com</a>. I&rsquo;ve maintained a peripheral view of Meteor, so it was good to get a beginner to intermediate overview of its capabilities. Given that I have been doing <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> client work as of lately, I am particularly interested in exploring <a href="https://github.com/slacy/minimongo">minimongo</a>.</p>

<p><img class="imgR400" alt="Jesse Cravens at Øredev 2013 HTML5 Hacks" src="http://jessecravens.github.io/images/oredev/html5hacks-oredev.jpg"></p>

<p>The city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a> was also a pleasure to experience, and as you might imagine, the people of Sweden were very welcoming. One of the highlights for me was the speaker dinner at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jorchr-Malm%C3%B6_r%C3%A5dhus.jpg">Malmö City Hall</a>, originally constructed in the Middle Ages. On a side note, I finally had a chance to meet and have dinner with <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglass Crockford</a>, a long time inspiration and virtual mentor, who was in town to give the keynote on <a href="http://oredev.org/2013/wed-fri-conference/managing-asynchronicity-with-rq">Managing Async with RQ</a>.</p>

<p>My first talk was a preview of my new book <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">O'Reilly&rsquo;s Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a>. I shared the stage with co-author and fellow frog, <a href="http://bashmodernquantity.com/about/">Thomas Q. Brady</a>. We took the audience through the creation of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook/rocknrollcall">RocknRollCall</a>, an intermediate level <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> application that fills in many of the blanks that most of the &lsquo;Getting Started&rsquo; applications don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><img class="imgL400" alt="O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js by Jesse Cravens" src="http://jessecravens.github.io/images/oredev/ember_cover_600.png"></p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the book, and the talk, cover topics such as: a survey of Ember tooling, debugging with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en">Ember Inspector</a>, Ember boilerplates, app initializers, promises in Ember, the needs API, Ember components, 3rd Party JavaScript Integration (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>), Ember testing, SPA authentication, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> and other client-side persistence solutions, and remote data persistence with Ruby On Rails and Node.js.</p>

<p>My second talk was <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">HTML5 Hacks</a> Evolved, where I continue to share more hacks from by first book <a href="http://html5hacks.com">HTML5 Hacks</a>, and <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">html5hacks.com</a>. This talk is culmination of HTML5 specifications that will have you rethinking browser-based applications. Some of the highlights of this talk included: Web Workers, WebSocket w/ GeoLocation, Device Orientation, and LeapJS, Web Components / Polymer / Ember Components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Model Driven Views, and Local Storage.</p>

<p>In 2014, I&rsquo;m retiring the HTML5 Hacks talks, to begin focusing solely on Single Page Application development in 2014. My hope is to kick out an early release of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a> very soon, and finish the book in early 2014. After that I&rsquo;ll be in Louisville, KY at <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa</a> to continue the Ember.js roadtrip.</p>

<p>For SXSWi and FluentConf this year, <a href="http://twitter.com/boyofgreen">@boyofgreen</a> and I created a demo application to showcase some of the hacks that we included in our book OReilly&rsquo;s HTML5 Hacks.</p>

<p>The demo application, Nerdclustr, is an HTML5 mobile application that brings &lsquo;nerds&rsquo; of all types together conferences and provides a visual map that updates in real time. The application was written with Node.js and the Express web framework. It demonstrates the following specifications: HTML5 Web Forms, Geo Location API, WebSocket, Canvas, CSS3 transforms.</p>

<p>Given, the attention that Web Components and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/polymer.html">Polymer.js</a> have been getting lately, I felt this was a good opportunity to demonstrate some of the exciting new specifications that are making their way to modern browsers. For the sake of this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll be using and providing screenshots of Google Chrome, but it should be worth your time to explore the status of each of the specifications in other modern browsers as well.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will take a look at the HTML5 specs mentioned above in detail. Then, we will explore Polymer.js and build out an example application.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Im giving a talk at Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco this afternoon: Client/Server 3.0: 6 Ways JavaScript is Revolutionizing the Client/Server Relationship. Here is the other talks on the agenda: <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/california/agenda.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<h3>1 Device Access Within the Browser</h3>

<p>The client gets smarter.</p>

<p>JavaScript Device APIs continue to evolve, allowing more access to device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications.
We will explore examples utilizing GeoLocation API, and Device Orientation.</p>

<h3>2 Client Side Processing w/ Background Threads</h3>

<p>The modern web browser&rsquo;s runtime is a single threaded, event loop. Asynchronous programming models, reactionary systems design actually benefit from this architecture. Maturing interpreters improve performance. Web Workers API enables background threads in the browser, making heavy computations realistic.</p>

<p>So, the client gets more powerful, and becomes an application development evnvironment.
We will explore Web Workers processing heavy computations without blocking the UI for further user interaction.</p>

<h3>3 Device Detection and Descriptors / Adaptive Frameworks</h3>

<p>Responsive Web Design is great, but it often isn&rsquo;t enough for larger applications, and applications that need to reach a highly fragmented device market. Adaptive frameworks use DDRs (Device Description Repositories)</p>

<p>We will explore a framework that mixes the best of Responsive with the best of Adaptive: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/responderjs">responderJS</a>.</p>

<h3>4 HTML5 Connectivity Revolution and HTTP 2.0</h3>

<p>Peter Lubbers coined the term, HTML5 Connectivity Revolution, to describe the next level, web network technologies such as: Web Sockets API, XHR2, Event Source and Server Sent Events, SPDY, CORS.</p>

<p>Engage in a demo of <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/robodeck">robodeck</a>, a Web Socket driven Collaborative presenations framework.</p>

<h3>5 Single Runtime, Shared Syntax &hellip; the right way</h3>

<p>Node.js has enabled the same language, single runtime. But, the paradigms are still quite different. Node streams, inspired by Linux pipes, make IO easy and intuitive. Explore pipe(), pump(), and events in Node streams.</p>

<p>Solutions like Browserify, help bring Node.js libraries and NPM dependency management to the browser. Next up, Domnode, wrapping common, client-side, I/O bound APIs (XHR, SSE, WebRTC, etc.) in Node streams syntax.</p>

<h3>6 Embedded JavaScript</h3>

<p>With Node.js, Angstrom Linux, and cloud document stores like MongoDB, the server is now embedded in the microcontroller client.</p>

<p>We will explore Arduino wrappers, and Node.js running on the Beaglebone from Texas Instruments.</p>

<p>The combination of Linux and JavaScript open worlds of opportunity.</p>

<p>Here is the node.js server used on the Beaglebone in the demo: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/beagleserver">beagleserver</a>.
The Johnny Five code is located here: <a href="https://github.com/nodejshacks/nodejshacks-embedded">node-embedded</a></p>

    <id>http://jessecravens.github.io/blog/2012/09/25/upcoming-talk-at-devcon5-austin-rapid-prototyping-html5-applications-with-nodejs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready for an upcoming talk titled: Rapid Prototyping HTML5 Applications with NodeJS, which I will presenting at <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/austin2012/Agenda/Agenda-at-a-glance.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; Austin</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<p>With HTML5, the modern web browser continues to mature as a capable application platform.
The new specifications are broad, impacting nearly every technology associated with modern web development including graphics, connectivity, client-side storage, offline access, graphics, multimedia, and performance.
JavaScript continues to be front and center as the core language. NodeJS extends JavaScript&rsquo;s event loop paradigm to the server, and provides JavaScript engineers with the ability to produce functionality deeper in the software stack. This phenomenon has had an impact on types of software development ranging from full-scale, enterprise, mobile applications to robot hobbyists platforms.
See innovative example solutions and learn why NodeJS is an ideal development platform for the production acceleration of next-generation HTML5 applications.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of a transition for me. With the release of HTML5 Hacks, I&rsquo;m beginning to focus more on my ubiquitous JavaScript content. I&rsquo;m excited, I have a lot to share.</p>

<p>Look for an update with a web based version of the slides.</p>
