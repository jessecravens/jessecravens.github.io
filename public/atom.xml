    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of November, I was given an opportunity to give two talks in Malmö, Sweden at the Øredev conference. First of all, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the conference. Although the theme was the Arts, I found it to be a developer&rsquo;s conference with an artsy edge. The speakers I had a chance to see were developer&rsquo;s developers, one of my favorites being a talk on Meteor by Chris Mather (@eventedmind) of <a href="http://eventedmind.com">eventedmind.com</a>. I&rsquo;ve maintained a peripheral view of Meteor, so it was good to get a beginner to intermediate overview of its capabilities. Given that I have been doing <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> client work as of lately, I am particularly interested in exploring <a href="https://github.com/slacy/minimongo">minimongo</a>.</p>

<p><img class="imgR400" alt="Øredev 2013 HTML5 Hacks" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/oredev/html5hacks-oredev.jpg"></p>

<p>The city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a> was also a pleasure to experience, and as you might imagine, the people of Sweden were very welcoming. One of the highlights for me was the speaker dinner at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jorchr-Malm%C3%B6_r%C3%A5dhus.jpg">Malmö City Hall</a>, originally constructed in the Middle Ages. On a side note, I finally had a chance to meet and have dinner with <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglass Crockford</a>, a long time inspiration and virtual mentor, who was in town to give the keynote on <a href="http://oredev.org/2013/wed-fri-conference/managing-asynchronicity-with-rq">Managing Async with RQ</a>.</p>

<p>My first talk was a preview of my new book <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">O&#8217;Reilly&rsquo;s Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a>. I shared the stage with co-author and fellow frog, <a href="http://bashmodernquantity.com/about/">Thomas Q. Brady</a>. We took the audience through the creation of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook/rocknrollcall">RocknRollCall</a>, an intermediate level <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> application that fills in many of the blanks that most of the &lsquo;Getting Started&rsquo; applications don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><img class="imgL400" alt="O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/oredev/ember_cover_600.png"></p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the book, and the talk, cover topics such as: a survey of Ember tooling, debugging with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en">Ember Inspector</a>, Ember boilerplates, app initializers, promises in Ember, the needs API, Ember components, 3rd Party JavaScript Integration (<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a>), Ember testing, SPA authentication, <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember-data</a> and other client-side persistence solutions, and remote data persistence with Ruby On Rails and Node.js.</p>

<p>My second talk was <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">HTML5 Hacks</a> Evolved, where I continue to share more hacks from by first book <a href="http://html5hacks.com">HTML5 Hacks</a>, and <a href="http://html5hacks.com/">html5hacks.com</a>. This talk is culmination of HTML5 specifications that will have you rethinking browser-based applications. Some of the highlights of this talk included: Web Workers, WebSocket w/ GeoLocation, Device Orientation, and LeapJS, Web Components / Polymer / Ember Components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Model Driven Views, and Local Storage.</p>

<p>In 2014, I&rsquo;m retiring the HTML5 Hacks talks, to begin focusing solely on Single Page Application development in 2014. My hope is to kick out an early release of <a href="https://github.com/emberjsbook">Building Web Apps with Ember.js</a> very soon, and finish the book in early 2014. After that I&rsquo;ll be in Louisville, KY at <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/">Code PaLOUsa</a> to continue the Ember.js roadtrip.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is mirrored from: <a href="http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/10/04/javascript-makers-how-js-is-helping-drive-the-maker-movement/">html5hacks.com</a></p>

<p><img class="imgR300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok1.jpg"></p>

<p>I spend my days writing a lot of JavaScript, and helping companies deliver ambitious UX focused applications to the web. I <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do?cmp=af-code-book-product_cj_9781449334994_7080585">author books</a> on the subject, blog, and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/jdcravens/">speak at conferences</a> as often as I can.</p>

<p>I work for <a href="http://frogdesign.com">frog</a>, a product design firm, that for the last forty years has been helping increase the profiles of brands like Sony and Apple through iconic design.</p>

<p>I work within a culture that has deep roots into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">the Maker Movement</a>; A culture that was making before the Maker Movement was cool, the &ldquo;original makers&rdquo; if you will. Written upon our walls and slide decks is the tag, <a href="https://vimeo.com/24940735">&lsquo;Love What You Make&rsquo;</a>, and as you might expect many of the frogs that sit around me are craftsfolk, DIYourselfers, and tinkerers. It is not uncommon to see a flying quadcopter, a mesh sensor network of Arduinos, 3D printed prototypes, explorations in next generation gesture with the Leap Motion and Kinect, video production, motion studies, 3D modeling, along with the standard artistic mood boards and web and native mobile application wireframes. Let&rsquo;s just say there is no shortage of creativity across every medium imaginable.</p>

<h2>Sharing My Craft with my Children</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference - setting up" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok2.jpg"></p>

<p>All of that being said, I&rsquo;m a parent of two young children. My little ones constantly challenge me to find ways to share quality time with them. The parents reading this know the juggling act.</p>

<p>What I try to do is architect bridges between my children&rsquo;s curiosity and the passions of others that have explored their crafts in a deep way. Myself, and my wife, being the most important of those craftsfolk.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m doing it right, when I spend time with my children, they should share in my excitement and passion. If I&rsquo;m doing it wrong, I&rsquo;m overwhelmed and exhausted from work. In my vision, my children should be witnessing a model of how to wake up everyday with the goal of embracing opportunity to create a combination of function and beauty within the world around them.</p>

<p><img class="imgR200" alt="Maker Faire" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/200ok/Maker_Faire.gif"></p>

<p>So it is in this context, that I met up with Mozilla&rsquo;s Luke Crouch, and <a href="http://makerfairetulsa.com/">Tulsa Mini Maker Faire</a>&rsquo;s Scott Phillips to put together <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">the closing keynote at the 200ok conference</a> .</p>

<h2>JavaScript Makers: How JS is Helping Drive the Maker Movement</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://200ok.us/schedule/javascript-makers/">200ok conference</a> is on track to become Oklaoma&rsquo;s premier web conference attracting a sold out crowd of web professionals from all over Oklahoma and the neighboring states. Going in, I felt as though I knew my audience well. In other words, if I spoke to them about languages they would understand, JavaScript and HTML5, my message would easily resonate. I also knew that given their location, Tulsa, OK, a presentation that touched upon work life balance and family values would immediate strike a chord as well.</p>

<p>So in the spirit of authenticity, I pretended as if getting prepared for a closing keynote dependent on hacked together hardware and software demos wasn&rsquo;t challenging enough; I made the decision to include my 6 year old son, Carter with a flying drone and a custom configured Minecraft server accessible over conference wifi. I knew this would ensure that the presentation dangled on the brink of disaster, mirroring the chaotic reality of both open hacking and parenting.</p>

<p>My thinking was that a presentation on this topic should be authentic, and reflect the reality of my proposition, not be an ivory tower, academic/authoritative talk about how to share your craft with your children. I also made sure to not prep Carter. With a loose structure in place, we took the stage and worked our way through a story that consisted of 12 open software and hardware demos that showcased JavaScript as a primary scripting language, and a table full of hardware that ranged from a drone, a dissected wifli helicopter and erector set, a leap motion, and numerous prototyping boards.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="10" data-id="78b4c9300a8801313e8202078d31cabc" data-ratio="1.2994923857868" src="http://jessecravens.com//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<h2>JavaScript and Prototyping Boards</h2>

<p>Earlier this year I did a presentation at HTML5.tx that focused on building an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H00_BGRkBRM">Internet of Things with JavaScript</a> and various open hardware prototyping boards such as Arduino, BeagleBone, and the Raspberry Pi. It was in that talk that I made a connection that eventually led to an introduction to Luke. So, given that the HTML5.tx content was of interest I started the presentation with a demo of the Arduino, <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny Five</a>, the original Beaglebone and <a href="https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript">BoneScript</a>.</p>

<p>Later, a crowd favorite was mapping the gestures from the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> to the <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR drone</a>, so that a one finger clockwise gesture triggered a nodecopter takeoff. A counter clockwise gesture then landed it. I was able to put this together using the leapJS and node-ardrone node modules, based on some initial hacking by <a href="https://twitter.com/markuskobler">Markus Kobler</a>, where he pulled this off at a <a href="https://github.com/markuskobler/nodecopter-london">Nodecopter London event</a>.</p>

<h2>ScriptCraft: Running JavaScript from within Minecraft</h2>

<p><img class="imgL300" alt="ok200 Conference" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/200ok/200ok3.jpg"></p>

<p>Later, I showed how to script inside of the Minecraft virtual world, using <a href="https://twitter.com/walter">Walter Higgins&#8217;</a> great <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft">ScriptCraft library</a>. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the conference wifi, and single access point, to suffice in allowing Carter and I to interact within virtual world. I was also concerned about the dynamic IP, and having to change it on the fly, start/restart the server, etc. So I made the decision 10 minutes before to not have Carter log in, and I would just speak to the possibility instead. In true 6 year old fashion, he rebelled and logged onto my server, popping up in front of me wearing a Creeper mask, as I was mid stream explaining how to script wooden signs with his 1st grade sight words as a homework exercise.</p>

<p>Needless to say, his innapropriate behavior was a crowd favorite. I have to admit, it was mine as well.</p>

<p>Going into the talk, I knew I&rsquo;d either be trying this again in the future or abandoning it as &lsquo;one of those ideas&rsquo; that sounded good in theory, but was just not going to work. Where did I land? Well, let&rsquo;s just say that Carter and I are looking for our next opportunity to share our experiences with other parents/web professionals.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As JavaScript-centric web applications continue to become the standard, and the browser continues to evolve into a full-featured web application platform, developers need powerful debugging tools to help quickly troubleshoot issues and fix them efficiently. Issues can range from HTML/CSS browser inconsistencies, JavaScript exceptions, and a myriad of performance issues that range from DOM access to network latency.</p>

<p>There a number of tools that web developers can use to help make debugging front end applications less painful.</p>

<p><img class="imgR400" alt="Debugging Modern Web Applications" src="http://tpstatic.com/img/usermedia/KRuw_KM2X0GCCs9xf497KA/original.png"></p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will walk through the top tools available and how to use these tools by addressing some of the most common issues faced in modern web application. This is a beginner to intermediate level tutorial for web developers getting started with debugging the web, or programmers coming from other languages who want to better understand how to troubleshoot client side JavaScript, the DOM, performance, and network calls.</p>

<p>To demonstrate we will be debugging a simple web application. The source code is available here: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/techpro-debugging.">https://github.com/jessecravens/techpro-debugging.</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JavaScript is executed in a single thread. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with threads, what this means is that JavaScript can only execute one block of code at a time. If code is already executing, any interaction by the user will instantiate an asynchronous event that is queued up for later execution. Other events like those from XMLHttpRequests and timers, are also added to the queue.</p>

<p>So, as you might expect, a single-threaded architecture can be problematic to the user experience if a particular script takes a long time to complete.</p>

<p>For SXSWi and FluentConf this year, <a href="http://twitter.com/boyofgreen">@boyofgreen</a> and I created a demo application to showcase some of the hacks that we included in our book OReilly&rsquo;s HTML5 Hacks.</p>

<p>The demo application, Nerdclustr, is an HTML5 mobile application that brings &lsquo;nerds&rsquo; of all types together conferences and provides a visual map that updates in real time. The application was written with Node.js and the Express web framework. It demonstrates the following specifications: HTML5 Web Forms, Geo Location API, WebSocket, Canvas, CSS3 transforms.</p>

<p>Given, the attention that Web Components and <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/polymer.html">Polymer.js</a> have been getting lately, I felt this was a good opportunity to demonstrate some of the exciting new specifications that are making their way to modern browsers. For the sake of this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll be using and providing screenshots of Google Chrome, but it should be worth your time to explore the status of each of the specifications in other modern browsers as well.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will take a look at the HTML5 specs mentioned above in detail. Then, we will explore Polymer.js and build out an example application.</p>

<p>This is an exploration of Handlebars.js template library when used with Ember.js views. Many of the Handlebars.js tutorials on the web discuss the Handlebars API, but not in the specific context of using Handlebars with Ember.js. In addition to filling that void, I&rsquo;ll also give a brief background of JavaScript templating in general to provide perspective as to the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>This tutorial will be divided into two parts. In Part 1, you should gain a clear understanding of JavaScript templates, the capabilities of Handlebars expressions and helpers, and how to write your own Handlebars helpers.</p>

<p>The following tutorial will provide an overview for building Ember.js applications with Yeoman. Keep in mind, Yeoman is a framework agnostic collection of tools, used to manage the workflow of any JavaScript application or plugin. For the sake of this tutorial, we have chosen to focus on Ember.js, as a case study.</p>

<p>Our workflow would not be complete without also setting up our testing strategy, so we will also include a standard BDD (Behavior Driven Development) setup with the Mocha testing framework.</p>

    <link href="http://jessecravens.com/blog/2013/04/21/push-notifications-to-the-browser-with-server-sent-events/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-21T15:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2013/04/21/push-notifications-to-the-browser-with-server-sent-events</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mirrored from: <a href="http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/04/21/push-notifications-to-the-browser-with-server-sent-events/">http://html5hacks.com/blog/2013/04/21/push-notifications-to-the-browser-with-server-sent-events/</a></p>

<p>Created by Opera, Server Sent Events standardizes Comet technologies. The standard intends to enable native real time updates through a simple JavaScript API called EventSource, which connects to servers that asynchronously push data updates to clients via HTTP Streaming. Server Sent Events use a single, unidirectional, persistent connection between the browser and the server.</p>

<p>Unlike the Web Socket API, Server Sent Events and EventSource object use HTTP to enable real-time server push capabilities within your application. HTTP Streaming predates the WebSocket API, and it is often referred to as Comet or server push. The exciting part here is that the Server Sent Events API intends to standardize the Comet technique, making it trivial to implement in the browser.</p>

<h2>What is HTTP Streaming?</h2>

<p>In a standard HTTP request and response between a web browser and a web server, the server will close the connection once it has completed the processing of the request. HTTP streaming, or Comet, differs in that the server maintains a persistent, open connection with the browser.</p>

<p>It is important to note that not all web servers are capable of streaming. Only evented servers such as Node.js, Tornado, or Thin are equipped incorporate an event loop that is optimal for supporting HTTP streaming. These, non-blocking servers handle persistent connections from a large number of concurrent requests very well.</p>

<p>A complete discussion on evented vs. threaded servers is out of scope for this post, but that being said, in the upcoming hack we will provide a very simple evented server implementation example to get you started. We provide a simple browser based JavaScript to connect to the server, and a server side implementation using Ruby, Thin, and Sinatra.
For the record, this is also very easy to do with Node.js.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the companion github repository:
<a href="https://github.com/html5hacks/chapter9">https://github.com/html5hacks/chapter9</a></p>

<h2>Ruby’s Sinatra</h2>

<p>The Sinatra documentation describes itself as a “DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.”
This text has focused primarily on Node.js (HTTP Server) and Express.js (web application framework) to quickly generate server side implementations for hacking out functionality.</p>

<p>It would a disservice to not mention Ruby, Rails and Sinatra in the same or similar light as we have Node.js in this text. Although learning Ruby is another learning curve, in the larger scheme of programming languages it is a less daunting curve than most. And as most die-hard Rubyists will preach, it is arguably the most elegant and fun to write of all modern programming languages. Ruby on Rails, and its little brother Sinatra are also great web application frameworks to start with if you are new to web application development.</p>

<p>Much like Node.js and Express, Sinatra makes building small server implementations nearly trivial. So for the context of HTML5 Hacks, that allows us to focus our efforts on programming in the browser.</p>

<p>For now let’s build a simple HTTP Streaming server using Sinatra.</p>

<p>To get started with Ruby On Rails or Sinatra, check out the great documentation available at <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a> and <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/intro">http://sinatrarb.com/intro</a>, respectively.</p>

<h2>Building Push Notifications</h2>

<p>Our goal in the next hack is to build a simple streaming server and use the EventSource object to open a persistent connection from the browser. We will then push notifcations from one ‘admin’ browser to all the connected receivers. Sounds simple, right? Let’s get started.</p>

<h2>A Simple HTTP Streaming Server</h2>

<p>Open up a file and name it stream.rb. Then add the following:
Simple requiring of Sinatra and the JSON library:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;json&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sinatra&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, we set up a public folder, and set the server to use the evented ruby server, Thin.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:public_folder</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;public&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">server</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;thin&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Set up two routs for serving our 2 pages: index and admin. We will use Erb as our templating language. The details are out of scope, but our use is very minimal. More on Erb here: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html">http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html</a></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">erb</span> <span class="ss">:index</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/admin&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">erb</span> <span class="ss">:admin</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We’d like to timestamp each notification, so here is a very simple function definition.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">timestamp</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">Time</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We also set up two empty arrays: one to hold the connections and the other to hold out notifications.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">connections</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">notifications</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, for the routes. When our browser loads it s page, we have JavaScript running which will use the EventSource object to connect to a url here: <a href="http://localhost:4567/connect.">http://localhost:4567/connect.</a></p>

<p>More on EventSource later.</p>

<p>But for now you can see the magic of the evented HTTP stream, the connection is held open until a callback is fired to close the stream.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'>  <span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/connect&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">provides</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;text/event-stream&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">connections</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">out</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="c1">#out.callback on stream close evt. </span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">callback</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="c1">#delete the connection </span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">connections</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">delete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">out</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, any data this posted to the /push route is pushed out to each connected device.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>stream.rb </span></figcaption>

<p>As we said before, you can just follow the instructions at our git repository to pull down and build this code. Or if you have been following along, launch a terminal, navigate to the directory where you code is, and run:</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 7-2" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-15.png"></p>

<p>Alright, so now that we have out Sinatra app up and running with custom routes to handle incoming requests from our browser.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t make complete sense yet, just hang loose. In the upcoming subsections, the rest of the items will start to fall into place.</p>

<h2>Set Up the HTML pages</h2>

<p>We will be building 2 pages: one for the admin to push out notifications, and the other will be for the connected receivers to receive the notification. Both of these ‘views’ will share the same layout, as such:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html </span></figcaption>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The admin page will contain an input tag and a simple button.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>admin.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;wrapper&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And our receiver pages will display a simple piece of text:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>receiver.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By launching one browser window to <a href="http://localhost:4567/admin">http://localhost:4567/admin</a> you should now see our admin form.</p>

<p>Figure 9.16 The initial admin page</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-16" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-16.png"></p>

<p>And, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567</a> in your browser and you should see.</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-17" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-17.png"></p>

<h2>Adding a bit of jQuery</h2>

<p>We need to add a bit of JavaScript to attach an event listener to the “send” button. This snippet will prevent the default submission of the form and post the notifcation object to the server as JSON.
Notice the url /push maps to the route we defined in our Sinatra app.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>push.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'> <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, lets open up five browser windows: one admin at <a href="http://localhost:4567/admin">http://localhost:4567/admin</a> and four more receivers at <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567</a></p>

<p>Figure 9.18 Opening 5 browser windows</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-18" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-18.png"></p>

<p>Looking good.</p>

<p>But before we get started, lets set up our EventSource.</p>

<h2>EventSource</h2>

<p>Event Source is a super simple JavaScript API for opening a connection with an HTTP stream.
Because our receiver pages are just ‘dumb’ terminals that receive data, we have an ideal scenario for Server Side Events.
Earlier, when we discussed the Sinatra app, we showed exposing a route for the browser to connect to an HTTP stream. Well, this is where we connect!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>es.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">es</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">EventSource</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/connect&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can add a simple notification with the available data,</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>es.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>And here is the final script for the admin:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Installing jQuery.notify</h2>

<p>For our Push Notifcations we will make use of Eric Hynds great jQuery plugin jquery-notify, located here at github: [github.com/ehynds/jquery-notify] (<a href="https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-notify">https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-notify</a>)</p>

<p>In order to display the notification, we will need to include some markup to the receiver page.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>receiver.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This creates a hidden div tag in the bottom of the document. We are not showing the CSS that uses “display: none” to hide it, but you can see more by examining the source code in the companion git repo.</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-19" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-19.png"></p>

<p>In order for jQuery.notify to initialize, you must first call the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>es.js </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>It’s that simple. The EventSource API is minimal and plugging it into a web framework like Sinatra or Node.js is straightforward.</p>

<p>Now, as we submit notifications from the admin page, our receiver pages are updated with time stamped notifications:</p>

<p>Using our best CDD (Conference Driven Devlopment) techniques, we walked the audience through the creation of <a href="http://nerdclustr.jit.su">Nerdclustr</a>: an HTML5 mobile Application that helps nerds find other like-minded nerds at conferences events.</p>

<p>Using realtime and mapping technolgies, the app visualizes nerd behavior in map pin clusters.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of the app in action (Ballroom G in the Austin Convention Center); it performed well during the presentation. Thanks to <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodjitsu</a> for the quality node.js WebSocket service. After a 2-day hackathon to get the app launched, I ran through a number of deployment options, many of which I have used before for Rails applications. <a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">Nodjitsu</a> won out in that it actually supported the WebSokcet protocol and made deployment super simple using the jitsu CLI.</p>

<p>Nerdclustr source code is available <a href="https://github.com/html5hacks/nerd-clustr">here</a>.</p>

<p>During the book signing, the bookstore informed us there were only 3 copies left. I&rsquo;m not keen to the selection process of books, but I was little surprised at the limited number of technical books. This is certainly a reflection of the SXSWi demographic, and we also tailored our content and presentation style to this audience.</p>

<p>The slide deck is available here:</p>

<p>I had a great time presenting at HTML5.tx 2013; here is an embed above of the slide deck. I should have the trailr node module in a presentable format soon and I&rsquo;ll tweet its inclusion in NPM. I have a placeholder here: <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/trailr">trailr at npm</a></p>

<p>I also pushed out the ver.1 trailr-admin UI here: <a href="http://trailr-admin.herokuapp.com/dashboard">trailr-admin.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>Most of the demos are included in the nodejshacks-emedded repo here: <a href="https://github.com/nodejshacks/nodejshacks-embedded">https://github.com/nodejshacks</a></p>

<p>Very soon, initial documentation will be available at: <a href="http://trailr.io">trailr.io</a></p>

    <link href="http://jessecravens.com/blog/2013/01/17/build-a-milestone-calendar-with-indexeddb-and-fullcalendar-dot-js/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-17T08:47:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2013/01/17/build-a-milestone-calendar-with-indexeddb-and-fullcalendar-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>IndexedDB is a persistent object data store in the browser. Although it is not a full SQL implementation and it is more complex than the unstructured key–value pairs in localStorage, you can use it to define an API that provides the ability to read and write key–value objects as structured JavaScript objects, and an indexing system that facilitates filtering and lookup.</h4>

<p>For this hack we will use IndexedDB to store milestone objects for a calendar application. The UI will provide a simple means to create a new milestone and provide a title, start date, and end date. The calendar will then update to show the contents of the local data store. Figure 6-8 shows the result.</p>

<p>Figure 6-8. FullCalendar.js and IndexedDB</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 6-8" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter6-images/6-8.png"></p>

<p>We need to start by including the markup for the two pieces of the UI: the calendar and the form.
We’ll begin with the form. You may notice that the input fields for the dates include data-date-format attributes. We will use these later for the JavaScript date pickers.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>milestone form </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>         &lt;div class="controls">

</span><span class='line'>           &lt;input type="text" name="title" value="">
</span><span class='line'>           &lt;input type="text" class="span2" name="start"
</span><span class='line'>             value="07/16/12" data-date-format="mm/dd/yy" id="dp1" >
</span><span class='line'>           &lt;input type="text" class="span2" name="end"

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      &lt;/fieldset>
</span><span class='line'> &lt;/form></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The calendar is provided by <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/">FullCalendar.js</a>, a fantastic jQuery plug-in for generating robust calendars from event sources. The library will generate a calendar from a configuration object and a simple div.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>simple div </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;div id='calendar'>&lt;/div></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And we can’t forget to include a few dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>CSS and JavaScript dependencies </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;link href="../assets/css/datepicker.css" rel="stylesheet">
</span><span class='line'>&lt;link href="../assets/css/fullcalendar.css" rel="stylesheet">
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js">&lt;/script>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script src="../assets/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js">&lt;/script>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script src="../assets/js/fullcalendar.min.js">&lt;/script></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To improve the user experience, we will also include date pickers for choosing the dates within the form fields for start and end dates (see Figure 6-9).</p>

<p>Figure 6-9. Date pickers</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 6-9" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter6-images/6-9.png"></p>

<p>To instantiate the date pickers we will include the following toward the beginning of our script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>instantiate the date pickers </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$(function(){
</span><span class='line'>    $('#dp1').datepicker();
</span><span class='line'>    $('#dp2').datepicker();
</span><span class='line'>  });</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>The Milestone IndexedDB</h3>

<p>Now we will set up a global namespace to hold our code, and set up a public milestones array (within the namespace) to hold our milestones temporarily while we pass them between our database and the FullCalendar API. This should make more sense as you continue to read. While we are at it we will need to normalize our indexedDB variable across all of the vendor-specific properties.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>namespace and normalize </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var html5hacks = {};
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>html5hacks.msArray = [];
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>var indexedDB = window.indexedDB || window.webkitIndexedDB ||
</span><span class='line'>                window.mozIndexedDB;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>if ('webkitIndexedDB' in window) {
</span><span class='line'>  window.IDBTransaction = window.webkitIDBTransaction;
</span><span class='line'>  window.IDBKeyRange = window.webkitIDBKeyRange;
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>Now we can begin to set up our database:
</span><span class='line'>html5hacks.indexedDB = {};
</span><span class='line'>html5hacks.indexedDB.db = null;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>function init() {

</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>init();</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will obviously fail for now, but as you can see the initialization begins by calling the open() method on an html5hacks.indexedDB. So let’s take a closer look at open():</p>

<p>First, we need to open the database and pass a name. If the database successfully opens and a connection is made, the onsuccess() callback will be fired.</p>

<p>Within the onsuccess, we then check for a version and call setVersion() if one does not exist. Then we will call createObjectStore() and pass a unique timestamp within the keypath property.</p>

<p>Finally, we call init() to build the calendar and attach the events present in the database.</p>

<p>At this point we are poised to retrieve all the data from the database and populate our calendar with milestones.
First, we declare the type of transaction to be a READ_WRITE, set a reference to the datastore, set a keyrange, and define a cursorRequest by calling openCursor and passing in the keyrange. By passing in a 0, we ensure that we retrieve all the values greater than zero. Since our key was a timestamp, this will ensure we retrieve all the records.</p>

<p>Once the onsuccess event is fired, we begin to iterate through the records and push the milestone objects to buildMilestoneArray:</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      return;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Adding Milestones</h3>

<p>Now that we are initializing and building our calendar, we need to begin adding milestones to the database via the form. First let’s use jQuery to set up our form to pass a serialized data object to addMilestone() on each submission:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>form submit </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$('form').submit(function() {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    var data = $(this).serializeArray();
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    html5hacks.indexedDB.addMilestone(data);
</span><span class='line'>    return false;
</span><span class='line'>  });</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now let’s submit a few events and then view them in the Chrome Inspector to ensure they are there (see Figure 6-10).</p>

<p>Figure 6-10. Viewing milestone objects in the Chrome Inspector</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 6-10" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter6-images/6-10.png"></p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at our addMilestone method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>addMilestone() </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>html5hacks.indexedDB.addMilestone = function(d) {
</span><span class='line'>  var db = html5hacks.indexedDB.db;
</span><span class='line'>  var trans = db.transaction(["milestone"], IDBTransaction.READ_WRITE);
</span><span class='line'>  var store = trans.objectStore("milestone");
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  var data = {
</span><span class='line'>    "title": d[0].value,
</span><span class='line'>    "start": d[1].value,
</span><span class='line'>    "end": d[2].value,
</span><span class='line'>    "timeStamp": new Date().getTime()
</span><span class='line'>  };
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  var request = store.put(data);
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  var dataArr = [data]
</span><span class='line'>  request.onsuccess = function(e) {
</span><span class='line'>    $('#calendar').fullCalendar('addEventSource', dataArr);
</span><span class='line'>  };
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  request.onerror = function(e) {
</span><span class='line'>    console.log("Error Adding: ", e);
</span><span class='line'>  };
</span><span class='line'>};</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We established our read/write connection in much the same way as our html5hacks.indexedDB.init(), but now, instead of only reading data, we write a data object to the data store each time by calling store.put() and passing it data. On the onsuccess we then can call fullcalendar’s addEventSource() and pass it the data wrapped in an array object. Note that it is necessary to transform the data object into an array since that is what the FullCalendar API expects.</p>

    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/11/28/client-server-3-dot-0-6-ways-javascript-is-revolutionizing-the-client-server-relationship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Im giving a talk at Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco this afternoon: Client/Server 3.0: 6 Ways JavaScript is Revolutionizing the Client/Server Relationship. Here is the other talks on the agenda: <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/california/agenda.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<h3>1 Device Access Within the Browser</h3>

<p>The client gets smarter.</p>

<p>JavaScript Device APIs continue to evolve, allowing more access to device hardware, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, system sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications.
We will explore examples utilizing GeoLocation API, and Device Orientation.</p>

<h3>2 Client Side Processing w/ Background Threads</h3>

<p>The modern web browser&rsquo;s runtime is a single threaded, event loop. Asynchronous programming models, reactionary systems design actually benefit from this architecture. Maturing interpreters improve performance. Web Workers API enables background threads in the browser, making heavy computations realistic.</p>

<p>So, the client gets more powerful, and becomes an application development evnvironment.
We will explore Web Workers processing heavy computations without blocking the UI for further user interaction.</p>

<h3>3 Device Detection and Descriptors / Adaptive Frameworks</h3>

<p>Responsive Web Design is great, but it often isn&rsquo;t enough for larger applications, and applications that need to reach a highly fragmented device market. Adaptive frameworks use DDRs (Device Description Repositories)</p>

<p>We will explore a framework that mixes the best of Responsive with the best of Adaptive: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/responderjs">responderJS</a>.</p>

<h3>4 HTML5 Connectivity Revolution and HTTP 2.0</h3>

<p>Peter Lubbers coined the term, HTML5 Connectivity Revolution, to describe the next level, web network technologies such as: Web Sockets API, XHR2, Event Source and Server Sent Events, SPDY, CORS.</p>

<p>Engage in a demo of <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/robodeck">robodeck</a>, a Web Socket driven Collaborative presenations framework.</p>

<h3>5 Single Runtime, Shared Syntax &hellip; the right way</h3>

<p>Node.js has enabled the same language, single runtime. But, the paradigms are still quite different. Node streams, inspired by Linux pipes, make IO easy and intuitive. Explore pipe(), pump(), and events in Node streams.</p>

<p>Solutions like Browserify, help bring Node.js libraries and NPM dependency management to the browser. Next up, Domnode, wrapping common, client-side, I/O bound APIs (XHR, SSE, WebRTC, etc.) in Node streams syntax.</p>

<h3>6 Embedded JavaScript</h3>

<p>With Node.js, Angstrom Linux, and cloud document stores like MongoDB, the server is now embedded in the microcontroller client.</p>

<p>We will explore Arduino wrappers, and Node.js running on the Beaglebone from Texas Instruments.</p>

<p>The combination of Linux and JavaScript open worlds of opportunity.</p>

<p>Here is the node.js server used on the Beaglebone in the demo: <a href="https://github.com/jessecravens/beagleserver">beagleserver</a>.
The Johnny Five code is located here: <a href="https://github.com/nodejshacks/nodejshacks-embedded">node-embedded</a></p>

    <link href="http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/11/18/configure-amazon-s3-for-cross-origin-resourse-sharing-to-host-a-web-font/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-18T19:42:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/11/18/configure-amazon-s3-for-cross-origin-resourse-sharing-to-host-a-web-font</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a specification that allows applications to
make requests to other domains from within the browser. With CORS you have a secure
and easy-to-implement approach for circumventing the browser’s same origin
policy.</p>

<p>In this hack we will explore hosting a web font on a cloud drive. In order to do so, we
will learn how to configure an Amazon S3 bucket to accept requests from other domains.</p>

<p>If you are not already familiar with web fonts and @font-face, refer to Hack #12.</p>

<p>In the next section I provide a bit more background on Amazon S3 and the same origin
policy, before we get into the details of CORS.</p>

<h3>What Is an Amazon S3 Bucket?</h3>

<p>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is simply a cloud drive. Files of all kinds can be
stored using this service, but web application developers often use it to store static
assets such as images, JavaScript files, and stylesheets.</p>

<p>For performance improvements, web developers like to employ Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs) to serve their static files. While Amazon S3 is not a CDN in and of itself,
it’s easy to activate it as one by using CloudFront.</p>

<p>A bucket refers to the directory name that you choose to store your static files.
To get started let’s set up an account at Amazon and navigate to the Amazon Management
Console; see Figure 9-21.</p>

<p>Figure 9-21. S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-21" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-21.png"></p>

<p>If we click on Create a Bucket we should see the prompt shown in Figure 9-22.</p>

<p>Figure 9-22. Creating an S3 bucket in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-22" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-22.png"></p>

<p>Let’s name the bucket and choose a region (see Figure 9-23). As I stated earlier, you
can choose a region to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory
requirements.</p>

<p>Figure 9-23. Naming an S3 bucket in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-23" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-23.png"></p>

<p>We will go ahead and name our bucket none other than “html5hacks.” You should now
see an admin screen that shows an empty filesystem (see Figure 9-24).</p>

<p>Figure 9-24. The html5hacks S3 bucket</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-24" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-24.png"></p>

<p>Well, that was simple. So why are we doing this? Let’s start with some simple browser
security—something called the same origin policy.</p>

<h3>Same Origin Policy</h3>

<p>As the browser becomes more and more of an application platform, application developers
have compelling reasons to write code that makes requests to other domains
in order to interact directly with the content. Wikipedia defines same origin policy as
follows:</p>

<p>In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a
number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. The
policy permits scripts running on pages originating from the same site to
access each other’s methods and properties with no specific restrictions,
but prevents access to most methods and properties across pages on different
sites.1</p>

<p>1 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy</a></p>

<p>As stated in Wikipedia’s definition, the same origin policy is a good thing; it protects
the end user from security attacks. But it does cause some challenges for web developers.</p>

<p>This is where CORS comes into the picture. CORS allows developers of remote data
and content to designate which domains (through a whitelist) can interact with their
content.</p>

<h3>Using Web Fonts in Your Application</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways to use a web font within your web pages, such as calling
the @font-face service, bundling the font within your application, hosting the web font
in your own Amazon S3 bucket (more on this later), or converting the file to Base64
and embedding the data inline in a data-uri. By the way, the last technique is similar
to the one outlined in Hack #13.</p>

<p>Each of these techniques has limitations.</p>

<ul>
<li>When calling the @font-face service you are limited to the fonts within the particular
service’s database.</li>
<li>Bundling the font within your application does not make use of HTTP caching, so
your application will continue to download the font file on every page request.
Furthermore, you cannot reuse the font within other applications.</li>
<li>Hosting the font in an Amazon S3 bucket works great, except with Firefox, which
enforces the same origin policy on all resources. So the response from the remote
server will be denied.</li>
<li>Converting the font to Base64 adds additional weight to the stylesheet, and does
not take advantage of caching.</li>
</ul>


<p>An exploration into the different types of web fonts is beyond the scope of this hack,
so I will assume that you have already selected the web font BebasNeue.otf.
You can download free and open fonts from sites such as <a href="http://www.dafont.com.">http://www.dafont.com.</a></p>

<h3>Uploading Your Font to Your Amazon S3 Bucket</h3>

<p>Now, all we have to do is to upload the font onto our filesystem in the cloud (see
Figure 9-25).</p>

<p>Figure 9-25. An uploaded BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-25" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-25.png"></p>

<h3>Adding the Web Font to Your Web Page</h3>

<p>In order to add a web font to our page, we need to add a single stylesheet to an HTML
page.</p>

<p>Here is our page. Let’s call it index.html, and add a <link> tag pointing to our base
stylesheet, styles.css.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>geo.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>S3 - font<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;styles.css&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>HTML5 Hacks<span class="err">&lt;</span>/&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In our styles.css let’s add the following and point to our uploaded file. Also, let’s assign
the font to our H1 header via the test class name.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>style.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">BebasNeue</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">src</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://s3.amazonaws.com/html5hacks/BebasNeue.otf&#39;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.test</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;BebasNeue&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we’ll open a browser and point to our newly created HTML page. In Opera (see
Figure 9-26), Safari, and Chrome our header tag is being styled correctly.</p>

<p>Figure 9-26. Opera browser showing the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-26" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-26.png"></p>

<p>But if we view it in Firefox, we are having issues (see Figure 9-27).</p>

<p>Figure 9-27. Firefox browser failing to show the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-27" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-27.png"></p>

<p>If we examine the request for our font in the Chrome Dev Tools Network tab, we will
see that the response from the server is empty (see Figure 9-28).</p>

<p>Figure 9-28. Firefox browser showing an empty response</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-28" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-28.png"></p>

<p>What gives? Well, by default, Firefox will only accept links from the same domain as
the host page. If we want to include fonts from different domains, we need to add an
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the font.</p>

<p>So, if you try to serve fonts from any CDN, Firefox will not load them.</p>

<h3>What Is CORS?</h3>

<p>The CORS specification uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send and receive headers
from the originating web page to a server that is properly configured in order to
enable cross-site requests.</p>

<p>The server accepting the request must respond with the
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with either a wildcard (*) or the correct
origin domain sent by the originating web page as the value. If the value is not included,
the request will fail.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for HTTP methods other than GET or POST, such as PUT, a preflight request
is necessary, in which the browser sends an HTTP OPTIONS request to establish
a handshake with the server before accepting the PUT request.</p>

<p>Fortunately, after enough backlash from the development community, Amazon made
CORS configuration available on Amazon S3 via a very simple XML configuration.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<h3>Configuring CORS at Amazon S3</h3>

<p>You should already be at your Amazon Management Console at <a href="http://">http://</a>
console.aws.amazon.com. Click on Properties→Permissions→Edit CORS configuration,
and you should receive a modal prompt.</p>

<p>The configuration can accept up to 100 rule definitions, but for our web font we will
only need a few. For this example we will use the wildcard, but if you are doing this in
production, you should whitelist the domains to prevent others from serving your font
from your S3 account on their own web pages. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but
it might get costly.</p>

<p>The first rule allows cross-origin GET requests from any origin. The rule also allows all
headers in a preflight OPTIONS request through the
Access-Control-Request-Headers header. In response to any preflight OPTIONS
request, Amazon S3 will return any requested headers.</p>

<p>The second rule allows cross-origin GET requests from all origins. The * wildcard
character refers to all origins.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config.xml </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;CORSConfiguration&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;CORSRule&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;</span>*/AllowedOrigin&gt;
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;AllowedMethod&gt;</span>GET<span class="nt">&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/CORSRule&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/CORSConfiguration&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, let’s add our new configuration to our Editor and save (see Figure 9-29).</p>

<p>Figure 9-29. Configuring CORS in the S3 Management Console</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-29" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-29.png"></p>

<p>Now, let’s return to Firefox and reload the page. We should now see the header font
styled with our BebasNeue web font, as shown in Figure 9-30.</p>

<p>Figure 9-30. Firefox browser successfully showing the BebasNeue font</p>

<p><img class="figure" alt="Figure 9-30" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/chapter9-images/9-30.png"></p>

<p>There is much more to learn about CORS, most notably, HTTP POST usage with certain
MIME types, and sending cookies and HTTP authentication data with requests if so
requested by the CORS-enabled server. So get out there and starting creating your
own CORS hacks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready for an upcoming talk titled: Rapid Prototyping HTML5 Applications with NodeJS, which I will presenting at <a href="http://www.html5report.com/conference/austin2012/Agenda/Agenda-at-a-glance.aspx">Devcon 5 &ndash; Austin</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary:</p>

<p>With HTML5, the modern web browser continues to mature as a capable application platform.
The new specifications are broad, impacting nearly every technology associated with modern web development including graphics, connectivity, client-side storage, offline access, graphics, multimedia, and performance.
JavaScript continues to be front and center as the core language. NodeJS extends JavaScript&rsquo;s event loop paradigm to the server, and provides JavaScript engineers with the ability to produce functionality deeper in the software stack. This phenomenon has had an impact on types of software development ranging from full-scale, enterprise, mobile applications to robot hobbyists platforms.
See innovative example solutions and learn why NodeJS is an ideal development platform for the production acceleration of next-generation HTML5 applications.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of a transition for me. With the release of HTML5 Hacks, I&rsquo;m beginning to focus more on my ubiquitous JavaScript content. I&rsquo;m excited, I have a lot to share.</p>

<p>Look for an update with a web based version of the slides.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a marathon of hackery starting in April, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/5370">Jeff Burtoft</a> and I pushed out 90 hacks and 435 pages of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do">HTML5 Hacks</a> this week. We also had a few guest hackers that created some really great content as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Raymond Camden of Adobe</li>
<li>Phil Legetter of Pusher.com</li>
<li>Alexander Schulze of jWebsocket</li>
<li><a href="http://j.hn/">John Dyer</a> of Dallas Theological Seminary</li>
<li>Alex Sirota of FoxyTunes</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it was a great experience. What I enjoyed the most was getting into a workflow groove, much like when you are building an API or contributing to a project. With each hack, it was necessary to ideate, plan, create the code, test it, and then put it into a understandable format. By the end, I was feeling pretty efficient at kicking out interesting hacks pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I felt as though I improved over time, looking back is always interesting. I like to keep fine tuning and revising, but at some point you have to ship the product. I&rsquo;m really proud of the work, it has been hard, but I learned a ton in the process.</p>

<p>Most of my hacks I tried to make relevant to real world software development challenges, and mix in a number of HTML5 specifications. Hopefully, that turns out to benefit the reader &hellip; I&rsquo;m all ears on the feedback. So don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop us a line.</p>

    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/09/23/migration-from-drupal-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>For the last 6 years, I have hosted my personal blog using Drupal at bluehost.com, and I finally have made the decision to migrate.</p>

<p>I have been using Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and Node.js for prototypes, demos, web-based presentations, and production apps, and deploying to Heroku for the past couple of years. The productivity gains and integration with github and social media, have brought me to the point that I&rsquo;d prefer for my workflow for blogging, updating to my microformats resume and portfolios to be similar to how I create and manage my other content.</p>

<p>So here, it is. Once I have written a proper migration script, and taken care of all the custom urls, I&rsquo;ll post my solution here.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a talk last March at USAA&#8217;s internal Tech X conference, I put together a demo of JavaScript script loaders, module definitions, dependency management, and polyfill support: <a href="http://jessecravens.github.com/js-modules-demo">JavaScript Modules</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://jessecravens.github.com/js-modules-demo/"><img class="imgL" width="500px" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/blogposts/js-modules.png"></a></p>

<p>This demonstrates the following Module Definitions:</p>




<ul>
<li>AMD</li>
<li>CommonJS</li>
<li>YUI3</li>
<li>JS Harmony</li>
</ul>




<p>And a few script loaders:</p>




<ul>
<li>RequireJS</li>
<li>yepnope</li>
<li>YUI3 - YUI Loader</li>
</ul>




<p>If you want to know more about the state of modules, dependency loading and management in the JavaScript world, there is always room for more contributors, just fork or clone the project &#8230; and you will have a playground to begin playing with some of the most popular implementations.</p>

    <link href="http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/04/22/hack-99-using-stylus-transparent-mixins-to-hack-vendor-specific-properties/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-22T19:11:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jessecravens.com/blog/2012/04/22/hack-99-using-stylus-transparent-mixins-to-hack-vendor-specific-properties</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most interesting features of <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus">Stylus</a> is transparent Mixins. One reason they are interesting is that at the time of this writing, this feature is exclusive to Stylus, other CSS metalanguages like Less and Sass do not offer Transparent Mixin support.</p>

<p>We already defined a mixin earlier, when we explored mixins with Jade. Here they are used similarly.</p>

<p>Before we begin with the transparent aspect of Stylus mixin support, let’s build a simple CSS mixin. Perhaps, the best example, as provided by TJ Holowaychuk in this <a href="http://www.screenr.com/bNY">beginner screencast</a> uses vendor-specific prefixes.</p>

<p>How about we take his example and expand it to a slightly more challenging scenario.</p>

<p>In case you haven’t come across this challenge before, lets set some context. Browser makers, or vendors, implement proprietary extensions to standard CSS specifications to release and test browser features that have been developed pre ‘Candidate Recommendation’ W3C draft status. Although vendor-specific prefixes can be frustrating for web developers, they are a necessary evil, allowing new properties to be widely tested before they become available as standard CSS properties.</p>

<p>Each Vendor maintains a list of their proprietary CSS properties. The following table provides the extension prefixes for all the modern browsers:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Extension</th>
<th>Rendering Engine</th>
<th>Browser(s)</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-moz-</td>
<td>Camino</td>
<td>Mozilla Firefox</td>
<td>-moz-border-radius</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-ms-</td>
<td>Trident</td>
<td>Internet Explorer</td>
<td>-ms-layout-grid</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-o-</td>
<td>Presto</td>
<td>Opera</td>
<td>-o-border-radius</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-webkit-</td>
<td>Webkit</td>
<td>Chrome, Safari</td>
<td>-webkit-border-radius</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>And here is a few valuable resources for finding these properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://css-infos.net/properties/webkit">Webkit-unofficial at css-infos.net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Articles/StandardCSSProperties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001266-SW1">Safari</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference/Mozilla_Extensions">Mozilla</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto28/css/o-vendor/">Opera</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx">Internet Explorer</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Without a metalanguage that provides logic to CSS, these declarations can become cumbersome and repetitive.
Here is an example of a div element that needs to have corners take on different size radiuses:</p>

<p>First, the markup in Jade.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example.html </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>header
</span><span class='line'>  h1= title
</span><span class='line'>  p Welcome to #{title}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>div.panel panel test
</span><span class='line'>div.mixin-panel mixin-panel test
</span><span class='line'>div.t-mixin-panel transparent-mixin-panel test
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, the styles in basic CSS.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.panel</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">moz</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span> <span class="m">5px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">webkit</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span> <span class="m">5px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">radius</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span> <span class="m">5px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This produces the following effect:</p>

<p><img src="http://jessecravens.com/images/blogposts/stylus-example265x185.png"/></p>

<p>With that context in mind, let’s leverage Stylus to help us manage our code. First, we are able to remove all parenthesis, semi-colons, and colons.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example2.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.panel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-moz-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">5px</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-webkit-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">5px</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">border-radius</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">5px</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Much like Jade, this simplified syntax goes along way in our ability to quickly write CSS. Now, let’s apply some logic, by creating a border-radius mixin, and pass our values as arguments to our mixin:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example3.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">my-border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(..</span><span class="nc">.args</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-moz-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-webkit-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.panel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">my-border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And we can reuse this mixin in other contexts, which continues to help reduce code bloat and keep your code DRY.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example4.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">my-border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(..</span><span class="nc">.args</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-moz-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-webkit-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.panel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">5px</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.other-panel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">3px</span> <span class="nt">32px</span> <span class="nt">100px</span> <span class="nt">55px</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">div</span><span class="nc">.another-panel</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">my-border-radius-mixin</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">5px</span> <span class="nt">10px</span> <span class="nt">33px</span> <span class="nt">43px</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>While Stylus allows us to name our mixin as we choose, we are also given the ability to apply mixins ‘transparently.’ In the case of a simple implementation of border-radius, a transparent mixin would make a lot of sense. In effect, this normalizes browser implementations and provides an abstraction layer for CSS developers.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>example5.css </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">border-radius</span> <span class="o">(..</span><span class="nc">.args</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">-moz-border-radius</span> <span class="nt">args</span>
