In the month of June, I had an opportunity to travel to Las Vegas to give a [workshop](http://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2014/schedule/workshop-info) and related [talk](http://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2014/schedule/day-1) at [Future Insights Live 2014](http://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2014/).
